William Colon
7-1 Final Project
Professional Self-Assessment




I have documented my ePortfolio development procedures in this repository as the capstone project for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. One of the most effective visual communication tools for demonstrating our value to potential employers is the development of a professional portfolio that highlights my unique abilities and talents. The ePortfolio's content serves as a reliable foundation for the development of concise concepts that demonstrate my proficiency in the fundamental areas of computer science. The artifacts of certain courses in the Computer Science Program that are included in this document demonstrate my progression in the critical areas of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. 

I could showcase my abilities in one category and illustrate them in other critical categories through the use of certain artifacts. The artifacts selected have been improved and presented beyond the course requirements as an individual program practice. This has established a high quality of work, addressed their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigated vulnerabilities. The portfolio suggests that I am highly motivated, well-organized, and accomplished in the field of Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering.



Self-Introduction
This is an informative self-introduction regarding the concepts of computer science courses that are relevant to my personal experiences is presented in this paper. It involves the exchange of personal opinions and perspectives, as well as a more in-depth and reflective engagement with course concepts and materials.
Career Choice
This presentation discusses my vocational decision and future aspirations as influenced by the Computer Science program. It reflects on the reasons for my sustained consistency in career planning and the evolution of my career perspective. I provide commentary on research regarding my career choices and their influence on my thought processes.

Reflection
 This reflects on my experiences during the tasks of the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. I elaborate on how I achieved the five-course goals by refining the artifacts in my ePortfolio, culminating in the successful creation of a professional ePortfolio that highlights my knowledge, skills, and competencies acquired from the Computer Science degree.
 Artifact
 I conduct a video code review for each artifact chosen in my original plan. In this code assessment, I outline my strategy for improvements. These code reviews entail an examination of current code and proposed improvements, highlighting the following essential components for each category:

Design and Engineering
 This document serves as a narrative accompanying the artifact enhancements for software design and engineering. This elucidates the rationale for the inclusion of the chosen artifact in this ePortfolio category and contemplates the methodology employed in its creation. The story emphasizes the knowledge acquired during the artifact's construction. The artifact exemplifies our capacity to employ creative skills and strategies for executing design solutions and achieving objectives. The capacity to develop solutions for software logic issues and rectify potential security design vulnerabilities.
Data Structure and Algorithms
 The artifact upgrades for algorithms and data structures are accompanied by a story in this study. This elucidates the rationale for the inclusion of the chosen artifact in this ePortfolio category and contemplates the methodology employed in its creation. The story emphasizes the learning acquired throughout the artifact's construction. The artifact encompasses design elements for authenticating and authorizing a user within the monitoring system, predicated on user credentials and the responsibility of user interactions with various module screens and activities, contingent upon their position in the monitoring system.
Databases
 This serves as a narrative accompanying the upgrades of database artifacts. This elucidates the rationale for the inclusion of the chosen artifact in this category of our ePortfolio and contemplates the methodology employed in its creation. The story emphasizes the knowledge acquired during the artifact's construction.
